# Ireland-2016-census-data
This project investigates the profile and trends of the population of Ireland according to census data from 2016. The census is carried out every five years by the Central Statistics Office (CSO). I conducted two studies. The first is an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) inspection of the distribution of Catholics and of people with a PhD degree or higher around the country, as well as correlations between them. The second study develops a clustering of counties in Ireland according to their number of Irish speakers. This was a final project for a module during my MSc in Data Science.
